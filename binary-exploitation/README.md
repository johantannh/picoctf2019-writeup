## Problem
>This [program](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/9e6254fb3c561cef02f30e7e90ef2ea7/vuln) executes any shellcode that you give it. Can you spawn a shell and use that to read the flag.txt? You can find the program in /problems/handy-shellcode_4_037bd47611d842b565cfa1f378bfd8d9 on the shell server. [Source](handy-shellcode/vuln.c).

### Hint
>How do you execute a program in a command line?

## Solution
Reference 
1. Writeup for [handycode-shell](https://medium.com/@isharaabeythissa/handy-shellcode-picoctf-2019-d1478cd336ae)
2. Build python docker Image - [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/_/python)
3. Python Virtual Environment to get requirements.txt - [link](https://medium.com/@boscacci/why-and-how-to-make-a-requirements-txt-f329c685181e)

We will try to use python to obtain the shell from the vulnerable code.

Steps
1. Create `DockerFile` with pwntools
2. Copy the relevant files by by editing the `DockerFile`
3. Build docker image in the folder `docker build -t handy-shellcode .`

Run docker 
1. `docker run -it --rm handy-shellcode` to run code directly
2. `docker run -it --rm -entrypoint=/bin/bash handy-shellcode` to get a shell to the container then run `python code.py`
 
![alt text](handy-shellcode/docker-run.JPG)
You can use this dockerfile to run other scripts that require pwntools as well.

Navigate to /problems/practice-run-1_0_62b61488e896645ebff9b6c97d0e775e on the shell server and run this [program](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/6eba3b66e7a2b786c6c9769711d85663/run_this) to receive a flag.

### Hint

## Solution
1. Use picoCTF shell on the website. Login using your picoCTF credentials
2. cd /problems/practice-run-1_0_62b61488e896645ebff9b6c97d0e775e

# OverFlow 0
Points: 100

## Problem
>This should be easy. Overflow the correct buffer in this [program](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/1730bdc8ccd557c8ff20d1c28a5c3dbe/vuln) and get a flag. Its also found in /problems/overflow-0_4_e130f4df1710865981d50f778a8059f7 on the shell server. [Source](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/1730bdc8ccd557c8ff20d1c28a5c3dbe/vuln.c).

### Hint
> Find a way to trigger the flag to print

> If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.

## Solution

The vulnerable code is
```c
void vuln(char *input){
  char buf[128];
  strcpy(buf, input);
}
```

There is only 128 char for the buffer. Any more will overwrite the stack and cause buffer overflow. 

TODO: Learn how to use GDB to see low level stack and understand how the stack is arranged

`./vuln $(python -c "from pwn import *; print 'a'*133")`

# OverFlow 1

## Problem
>You beat the first overflow challenge. Now overflow the buffer and change the return address to the flag function in this [program](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/8b7521756bddb2cce5c14fd2b60cd354/vuln)? You can find it in /problems/overflow-1_3_f08d494c74b95dae41bff71c2a6cf389 on the shell server. [Source](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/8b7521756bddb2cce5c14fd2b60cd354/vuln).

### Hint
> Take control that return address

> Make sure your address is in Little Endian.
