# Insp3ct0r
Points: 50

## Problem
>Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/63975/ or ttp://2019shell1.picoctf.com:63975

### Hint
>How do you inspect web code on a browser?
>There's 3 parts

## Solution
1) Inspect source of main page https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/63975 by right clicking on page and selecting "View page source". Part 1 of flag can be found in this page
2) Inspect source of css file "mycss.css". Part 2 of flag can be found in this page
3) Inspect source of js file "myjs.js". Part 3 of flag can be found in this page

## Problem
>Can you break into this super secure portal? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/45147/ or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:45147

### Hint
>Never trust the client

## Solution
1. Go to chrome or FF inspector, look at debugger
2. Find the index javascript file. There is a client sided check.
```javascript
checkpass = document.getElementById("pass").value;
    split = 4;
    if (checkpass.substring(0, split) == 'pico') {
      if (checkpass.substring(split*6, split*7) == 'a60f') {
        if (checkpass.substring(split, split*2) == 'CTF{') {
         if (checkpass.substring(split*4, split*5) == 'ts_p') {
          if (checkpass.substring(split*3, split*4) == 'lien') {
            if (checkpass.substring(split*5, split*6) == 'lz_4') {
              if (checkpass.substring(split*2, split*3) == 'no_c') {
                if (checkpass.substring(split*7, split*8) == '3}') {
                  alert("Password Verified")
                  }
                }
              }
      
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
```
A bit of obfuscation, the code confuses you by checking substrings every 4 letters and not sequentially.

Just rearrange from split to split*8 and you will get the answer
1. (0, split) == 'pico'
2. (split, split*2) == 'CTF{'
3. (split*2, split*3) == 'no_c'
4. (split*3, split*4) == 'lien'
5. (split*4, split*5) == 'ts_p'
6. (split*5, split*6) == 'lz_4'
7. (split*6, split*7) == 'a60f'
8. (split*7, split*8) == '3}'

## Problem
>The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as logon and find what they've been looking at? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/45163 or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:45163 

### Hint
>Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for {{name}}'s?

## Solution
1. Just type username as logon
2. Use Chrome or Firefox developer console, find cookies
3. Change `admin` value to `True`. Refresh the page

### Hint
>What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Solution
1. Axcess the robots.txt file by appending it to the url given.
2. In robots.txt, there is a file under Disallow section.
3. Access the file by appending it to the url given. The flag is then shown.

## Problem
>Can you break into this super secure portal? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12278/ or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:12278

### Hint
>What is obfuscation?

## Solution

1. Same as client side just inspect the code, this time it is way more complicated.

```javascript
var _0x5a46=['25df2}','_again_b','this','Password\x20Verified','Incorrect\x20password','getElementById','value','substring','picoCTF{','not_this'];

(function(_0x4bd822,_0x2bd6f7){
    var _0xb4bdb3=function(_0x1d68f6){
        while(--_0x1d68f6){
            _0x4bd822['push'](_0x4bd822['shift']());
        }
    };
    _0xb4bdb3(++_0x2bd6f7);
}(_0x5a46,0x1b3));

var _0x4b5b=function(_0x2d8f05,_0x4b81bb){
    _0x2d8f05=_0x2d8f05-0x0;
    var _0x4d74cb=_0x5a46[_0x2d8f05];
    return _0x4d74cb;
};

function verify(){
    checkpass=document[_0x4b5b('0x0')]('pass')[_0x4b5b('0x1')];
    split=0x4;
    if(checkpass[_0x4b5b('0x2')](0x0,split*0x2)==_0x4b5b('0x3')){
        if(checkpass[_0x4b5b('0x2')](0x7,0x9)=='{n'){
            if(checkpass[_0x4b5b('0x2')](split*0x2,split*0x2*0x2)==_0x4b5b('0x4')){
                if(checkpass[_0x4b5b('0x2')](0x3,0x6)=='oCT'){
                    if(checkpass[_0x4b5b('0x2')](split*0x3*0x2,split*0x4*0x2)==_0x4b5b('0x5')){
                        if(checkpass['substring'](0x6,0xb)=='F{not'){
                            if(checkpass[_0x4b5b('0x2')](split*0x2*0x2,split*0x3*0x2)==_0x4b5b('0x6')){
                                if(checkpass[_0x4b5b('0x2')](0xc,0x10)==_0x4b5b('0x7')){
                                    alert(_0x4b5b('0x8'));
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    else{
        alert(_0x4b5b('0x9'));
    }
}
```
10 values in data. index 0 starts at getElementById until index 9 'Incorrect\x20password'
var _0x5a46=['25df2}','_again_b','this','Password\x20Verified','Incorrect\x20password','getElementById','value','substring','picoCTF{','not_this'];
1. 'getElementById' = `_0x4b5b('0x0')`
2. 'value' = `_0x4b5b('0x1')`
3. 'substring' = `_0x4b5b('0x2')`
4. 'picoCTF{' = `_0x4b5b('0x3')`
5. 'not_this' = `_0x4b5b('0x4')`
6. '25df2}' = `_0x4b5b('0x5')`
7. '_again_b' = `_0x4b5b('0x6')`
8. 'this' = `_0x4b5b('0x7')`
9. 'Password\x20Verified' = `_0x4b5b('0x8')`
10. 'Incorrect\x20password' is `_0x4b5b('0x9')`

Now we can solve the remaining. Ignore the noise do the same thing as before, sort by split, except thist time in hexa

1. (0x0,split*0x2)==_0x4b5b('0x3') = `picoCTF{`
2. (split*0x2,split*0x2*0x2)==_0x4b5b('0x4') = `not_this`
3. (split*0x2*0x2,split*0x3*0x2)==_0x4b5b('0x6') = `_again_b`
4. (split*0x3*0x2,split*0x4*0x2)==_0x4b5b('0x5') = `25df2}`

The rest are just obfuscation to confuse you but you can ignore but basically is just checking hexa 
7 to 9, 3 to 6, 6 to b, c to 10. Which is the same as above answer
5. (0x7,0x9)=='{n'
6. (0x3,0x6)=='oCT'
7. (0x6,0xb)=='F{not'
8. (0xc,0x10)==_0x4b5b('0x7') = `this`

# Open-to-admins
Points: 200

## Problem
>This secure website allows users to access the flag only if they are **admin** and if the **time** is exactly 1400. https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/49858/  or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:49858

### Hint
>Can cookies help you to get the flag?

## Solution
The biggest hints are cookies, time and admin.

1. Using postman, setup a proxy between firefox and postman.
2. Capture 4 different redirects
3. The last redirect to https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/49858/, has a cookie. Use that API request and modify the cookie header.
4. Set cookie: `cookie:session=""; admin=true; time=1400;` 
5. Send `GET` request to https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/49858/flag

Or even simpler, just send a https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/49858/flag GET request with a single header
1. `cookie:session=""; admin=true; time=1400;`

Can probably use curl or some other way to achieve this as well.

# picobrowser

## Problem
>This website can be rendered only by picobrowser, go and catch the flag! https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21851/ or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:21851

### Hint
>What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Solution
1. Use web developer console, notice that there is a redirect before accessing the real page.
2. Edit the /flag with status 200, change `User Agent` to `picobrowser`
3. Send and look at the response.

To Learn: Use Burpsuite or Postman to capture the request as a proxy, modify it and resend.

### Hint
>There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this, I wonder if the users are kept in a database?
>Try to think about how does the website verify your login?

## Solution
1. Click the nav bar at top left > admin login
2. inspect the page, notice a hidden field called `debug`
3. Change the debug value to 1, refresh the page
4. Notice the SQL query being used. Signifies SQL injection can be done.
5. Just use a typical SQL injection query on name `' OR 1=1;--`

### Hint

## Solution
1. Click the nav bar at top left > admin login
2. inspect the page, notice a hidden field called `debug`
3. Change the debug value to 1, refresh the page
4. Notice the SQL query being used. Signifies SQL injection can be done.
5. Since the previous injection query has been filtered and the hint says the password has been filtered, use another SQL injection query that ignores the paassword field on the name field `'admin'--.
